Project Brief:

The web application allows users to book book shipments or packages and movers internationally by ship.
Users can enter the shipping details, including the origin and destination addresses, package dimensions and weight, and other relevant information.
The application calculates the shipping cost based on the entered details and displays it to the user.
Users can then proceed to pay for the shipping and receive a confirmation of their booking.
Packages.json:

The packages.json file lists the dependencies used in the project, including React, React Router DOM, Tailwind CSS, and various testing libraries.
These dependencies are used to build the user interface, handle routing between pages, and perform testing of the application.
Additionally, various icon libraries are used to enhance the visual design of the application.
App.js:

The App.js file contains the main logic of the web application.
It imports various components, including SearchForm, LoggedIn, and Shipping, and uses them to define the routes of the application.
The useNavigationType and useLocation hooks are used to handle scrolling to the top of the page when navigating between routes and updating the page title and meta description based on the current route.
The BrowserRouter component is used to handle client-side routing of the application.
Overall, it seems like you have used a variety of modern web development tools and techniques to create a web application for booking book shipments or packages and movers internationally by ship. With proper testing and implementation, this could potentially be a useful tool for individuals and businesses looking to ship items internationally.
